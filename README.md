# SUPERHERO PROJECT

## Introduction

Welcome to my end-of-phase 1 project assignment! Get ready to rumble with the Superhero Battler! Pick your favorite superhero's to match against each other, see who wins!

## Description

This SPA opens with a load event listener that prepares the user for the upcoming battle. 

Next the rest of the page loads along with the CSS. The fetch of the external API (https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/all.json) then loads the hero's onto the page.

The user can than mouseover each hero to see their name and stats, using a mousover event listener. The user then clicks on two differeent hero's to add to the battle ring, using a click event listener. 

Once the heroes are selected, they show up in the middle of thee screen ready for battle! The user then hits another click event listener to click the "Fight!" button, and function that pits both heroes power levels against eachother, calculates the winner. The winner is then announced underneath the battlefield.

For each win each hero tallys, they are added to their proper standing on the leaderboard on the bottom of the page. 

## Closing

Well that's it for my Superhero Battler! Hope you enjoyed! And I hope the never-ending arguement of which of your favorite heroes would win in your favorite match-ups, has been solved!
